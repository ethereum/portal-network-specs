# Execution Canonical Transaction Index Network

This document is the specification for the sub-protocol that supports on-demand availability of the index necessary for clients to lookup transactions by their hash.


## Overview

The canonical transaction index network is a [Kademlia](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) DHT that uses the [Portal Wire Protocol](../portal-wire-protocol.md) to establish an overlay network on top of the [Discovery v5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-wire.md) protocol.

The canonical transaction index consists of a mapping from transaction hash to the canonical block hash within which the transaction was included and the index of the transaction within the set of transactions executed within that block.


### Data

#### Types

- Transaction Index Entry


#### Retrieval

- Transaction index entries can be retrieved by transaction hash.


## Specification

### Distance Function

The canonical transaction index network uses the stock XOR distance metric defined in the portal wire protocol specification.


### Content ID Derivation Function

The canonical transaction index network uses the SHA256 Content ID derivation function from the portal wire protocol specification.


### Wire Protocol

The [Portal wire protocol](../portal-wire-protocol.md) is used as wire protocol for the canonical transaction index network.


#### Protocol Identifier

As specified in the [Protocol identifiers](../portal-wire-protocol.md#protocol-identifiers) section of the Portal wire protocol, the `protocol` field in the `TALKREQ` message **MUST** contain the value of `0x500D`.


#### Supported Message Types

The canonical transaction index network supports the following protocol messages:

- `Ping` - `Pong`
- `Find Nodes` - `Nodes`
- `Find Content` - `Found Content`
- `Offer` - `Accept`


#### `Ping.payload` & `Pong.payload`

In the canonical transaction index network the `payload` field of the `Ping` and `Pong` messages. The first packet between another client MUST be [Type 0: Client Info, Radius, and Capabilities Payload](../ping-extensions/extensions/type-0.md). Then upgraded to the latest payload supported by both of the clients.

-  [Type 1 Basic Radius Payload](../ping-extensions/extensions/type-1.md)


### Routing Table 

The canonical transaction index network uses the standard routing table structure from the Portal Wire Protocol.

### Node State

#### Data Radius

The canonical transaction index network includes one additional piece of node state that should be tracked.  Nodes must track the `data_radius` from the Ping and Pong messages for other nodes in the network.  This value is a 256 bit integer and represents the data that a node is "interested" in.  We define the following function to determine whether node in the network should be interested in a piece of content.

```
interested(node, content) = distance(node.id, content.id) <= node.radius
```

A node is expected to maintain `radius` information for each node in its local node table. A node's `radius` value may fluctuate as the contents of its local key-value store change.

A node should track their own radius value and provide this value in all Ping or Pong messages it sends to other nodes.


### Data Types

#### Transaction Hash Mapping

```
transaction_index_key  := Container(transaction-hash: Bytes32)
selector               := 0x00

content_key            := selector + SSZ.encode(transaction_index_key)
content                := TODO: block hash & merkle proof against header.transactions_trie
```
