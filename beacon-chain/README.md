## Beacon Chain Light Client
The networks described in this directory are intended to support beacon chain light clients.

See discussion on how to [classify](https://ethresear.ch/t/beacon-chain-light-client-classification/11061
) beacon chain light clients.

- Minimal light client [spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/a20f6f7b5f40292c2a864337336bff74ae318354/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md#altair----minimal-light-client)
- A [proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-beacon-chain-light-client-proposal/11064) for a light client that supports APIs on beacon chain state.
