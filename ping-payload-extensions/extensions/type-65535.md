# Error Payload

If the ping receiver can't handle the ping for any reason the pong should return an error payload

Pong payload
```python

# Max UTF-8 hex encoded strings length
MAX_ERROR_BYTE_LENGTH = 300

error_payload = SSZ.serialize(Container(error_code: u16, message: ByteList[MAX_ERROR_BYTE_LENGTH]))

Pong Message = Container(
  enr_seq: uint64,    
  type: 65535,
  payload: error_payload
)
```
