# Chain History Storage Network

This document is a preliminary specification for a networking protocol that supports on-demand availability of Ethereum chain history data.

## Overview

Chain history data consists of historical block headers, block bodies (transactions and omners), and receipts.

The chain history storage network is a [Kademlia](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) DHT that forms an overlay network on top of the [Discovery v5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-wire.md) network. The term *overlay network* means that the history network operates with its own independent routing table and uses the extensible `TALKREQ` and `TALKRESP` messages from the base Discovery v5 protocol for communication.

The `TALKREQ` and `TALKRESP` protocol messages are application-level messages whose contents are specific to the history protocol. We specify these messages below.

The history protocol uses the node table structure from the Discovery v5 network and the lookup algorithm from section 2.3 of the Kademlia paper.

### Data

Types:

* Block headers
* Block bodies
    * Transactions
    * Omners
* Receipts

Lookups:

* Block header by block header hash
* Block body by block header hash
* Block receipts by block header hash

This specification does not support block lookups by number or transaction lookups by hash. To support these lookups, we will require a specification for a block header accumulator so that we can return the canonical block for a given height or the transaction for a given hash included in some canonical block.

## Specification

### Distance

Nodes in the history network are represented by their [EIP-778 Ethereum Node Record (ENR)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778) from the Discovery v5 network. A node's `node-id` is derived according to the node's identity scheme, which is specified in the node's ENR. A node's `node-id` represents its address in the DHT.

The `node-id` is a 32-byte identifier. We define the `distance` function that maps a pair of `node-id` values to a 256-bit unsigned integer identically to the Discovery v5 network.

```
distance(n1, n2) = n1 XOR n2
```

Similarly, we define a `logdistance` function identically to the Discovery v5 network.

```
logdistance(n1, n2) = log2(distance(n1, n2))
```

### Content: Keys and Values

The chain history DHT stores the following data items:

* Block headers
* Block bodies
* Receipts

Each of these data items are represented as a key-value pair. Denote the key for a data item by `content-key`. Denote the value for an item as `content`.

All `content` items are transmitted as RLP-encoded byte arrays.

We derive a `content-id` from the `content-key` as `H(content-key)` where `H` denotes the SHA-256 hash function, which outputs 32-byte values. The `content-id` represents the key in the DHT that we use for `distance` calculations.

All `content-key` values are encoded and decoded according to SSZ sedes.

#### Block Header

```
content-key  = Container(chain-id: uint16, content-type: uint8, block-hash: Bytes32)
content-type = 0x01
```

#### Block Body

```
content-key  = Container(chain-id: uint16, content-type: uint8, block-hash: Bytes32)
content-type = 0x02
```

#### Receipts

```
content-key  = Container(chain-id: uint16, content-type: uint8, block-hash: Bytes32)
content-type = 0x03
```

### Radius

We define a `distance` function that maps a `node-id` and `content-id` pair to a 256-bit unsigned integer identically to the `distance` function for pairs of `node-id` values.

Each node specifies a `radius` value, a 256-bit unsigned integer that represents the data that a node is "interested" in.

```
interested(node, content) = distance(node.id, content.id) <= node.radius
```

A node is expected to maintain `radius` information for each node in its local node table. A node's `radius` value may fluctuate as the contents of its local key-value store change.

### Wire Protocol

The [Portal wire protocol](./portal-wire-protocol.md) is used as wire protocol for the state network.

The `protocol-id` in the `TALKREQ` message is defined as "portal-state".

All protocol messages are supported.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Node State

We adapt the node state from the Discovery v5 protocol. Assume identical definitions for the replication parameter `k` and a node's k-bucket table. Also assume that the routing table follows the structure and evolution described in section 2.4 of the Kademlia paper.

Nodes keep information about other nodes in a routing table of k-buckets. This routing table is distinct from the node's underlying Discovery v5 routing table.

A node associates the following tuple with each entry in its routing table:

```
node-entry := (node-id, radius, ip, udp)
```

The `radius` value is the only node information specific to the overlay protocol. This information is refreshed by the `Ping` and `Pong` protocol messages.

A node should regularly refresh the information it keeps about its neighbors. We follow section 4.1 of the Kademlia paper to improve efficiency of these refreshes. A node delays `Ping` checks until it has a useful message to send to its neighbor.

When a node discovers some previously unknown node, and the corresponding k-bucket is full, the newly discovered node is put into a replacement cache sorted by time last seen. If a node in the k-bucket fails a liveness check, and the replacement cache for that bucket is non-empty, then that node is replaced by the most recently seen node in the replacement cache.

Consider a node in some k-bucket to be "stale" if it fails to respond to β messages in a row, where β is a system parameter. β may be a function of the number of previous successful liveness checks or of the age of the neighbor. If the k-bucket is not full, and the corresponding replacement cache is empty, then stale nodes should only be flagged and not removed. This ensures that a node who goes offline temporarily does not void its k-buckets.

### Lookup

We use the lookup algorithm described in section 2.3 of the Kademlia paper. A "node lookup" is the execution of the algorithm to find the `k` closest nodes to some `node-id`. A "content lookup" is the execution of the algorithm to find the data for `content-id` or the `k` closest nodes to `content-id`.

A `FindNode` request corresponds to a node lookup, and a `FindContent` request corresponds to a content lookup.

The lookup algorithm is also used to identify nodes that should receive `Offer` messages to store some data.

### Joining the Network

We follow the join procedure described in the Kademlia paper.

In order to join the network, a node `u` must know some node `v` who is already participating in the network. Node `u` inserts `v` into the appropriate k-bucket and then sends a `FindNode` request to `v` for its own node ID. Then, node `u` refreshes all k-buckets with distances further than its closest neighbor. To refresh a bucket, a node selects a random node ID in the bucket's range and performs a `FindNode` for that ID.

### Finding Nodes

A node's routing table is initially populated by the `FindNode` messages that the node sends when it joins the network.

Following the join phase, a node's k-buckets are generally kept fresh by network traffic. When a node learns of a new contact (through node lookups), it attempts to insert the contact into the appropriate k-bucket. A node keeps track of the last node lookup it performed for each k-bucket, and it will regularly refresh any k-buckets with no recent lookups.

### Finding Content

To find a piece of content for `content-id`, a node performs a content lookup via `FindContent`. If the lookup succeeds, then the requestor sends a `Offer` message for the content to the closest node it observed that did not return the value and whose `radius` contains `content-id`.

### Storing Content

To store a piece of content with key `content-id`, a node performs a lookup to find the `k` closest nodes with radii that contain `content-id`. Then the node sends `Offer` RPCs to those nodes. For any node that responds to the `Offer` RPC with a `Accept` RPC, the local node responds with a `Store` RPC for the content.

The network cannot make guarantees about the storage of particular content. A lazy node may ignore all `Offer` RPCs. A malicious node may send `Accept` RPCs and ignore the `Store` RPCs. The offer-accept mechanism is in place to require that nodes explicitly accept some data before another node attempts to transmit that data. The mechanism prevents the unnecessary consumption of bandwidth in the presence of lazy nodes. However, it does not defend against malicious nodes who accept offers for data with no intent to store it.
