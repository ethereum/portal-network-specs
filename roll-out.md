# Portal Network Go-Live Plan

A rough plan for taking the Portal Network "live" that includes delivering the
minimum set of network functionality to host the core of the Ethereum data set
as well as engaging the community to bring enough nodes online to make the
network healthy.

## What

A public launch event where we are focused on onboarding users and bringing
nodes online to bootstrap the network into a healthy state.

### Network Functionality

For the networks, we need to have the following functionality ready to go.

- Full history network
  - Full history of block headers/bodies/receipts
- Beacon chain network
  - Ability to follow the head of the chain.
- State network
  - Full "latest" state.
  - Maybe archival state.

### Infrastructure

We will need good monitoring and visualization tools.

- Measure total network storage capacity
- Measure total network size (node count) and client diversity
- Effective "auditing" of network data.

### Documentation

All clients should 

- have solid documentation for how to run their clients
- be ready to engage with the community as they run into issues

### Marketing

This is an event that will play out over the course of multiple weeks.  Leading
up to the event we'll want to do a bunch of marketing to the broader Ethereum
community to get them excited about the project and knowledgeable about what
we're doing.

## Why

Internally, this gives the project a clear goal to work towards.  We know what needs to be built and can focus on things that bring us closer to that goal.

Externally, this provides visibility into the project and way to engage the broader community.

## When

We can only really do this once we have clients that support all of the base
network functionality.  This seems reasonable to have ready early 2024.
